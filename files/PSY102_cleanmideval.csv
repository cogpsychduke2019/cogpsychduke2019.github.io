"Overall, I just find the material pretty interesting. I also like how we peer-review our work.",n/a,"I think the quizzes tend to be a little long. I think more time should be allotted to them or they should be shortened. Moreover, I think that reading articles again every night can get a little boring, especially when we have another assignment due the next day.","I really enjoy the demos we do in class, as well as the interesting SciComm pieces.",Yes,,5,3,10,4,4,4

I like how the instructor provides additional practice problems to allow ourselves to test our knowledge. I also like the idea of connecting what we are learning to various current journal articles.,"Sometimes it is difficult to see the connection between the content of the course and the journals that we read. Often, the articles are at a higher/more in depth level than the content of the course, so it can be difficult to figure out what the takeaways should be for a given article. A general ""so what"" for each article could be helpful","The course could be improved by having more dedicated days for content. Instead of covering content and discussing the journal articles, I think my learning would be facilitated by having one day dedicated to just learning the content, and then another day for going over the articles we have read, and connecting the material to the article.  ",,Yes,"Sometimes the slides move a little too fast, so it can be hard to write down the important points and focus on the discussion. ",4,3,9,3,3,4
I like how flexible it is to my learning. We are able to choose what articles we want to do assignments on.,"I wish there were slightly more in depth instructions to the assignments, as it is sometimes a little confusing on what to do.",I don't see any.,It's good as it is.,Yes,Nope.,5,2,3,5,5,5
