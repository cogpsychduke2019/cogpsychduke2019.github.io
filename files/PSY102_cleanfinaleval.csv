This class took an open science approach to pedagogy. That meant creating transparency for both teachers within & outside of Duke as well as for you as students. For instance, the website was updated on a daily basis, allowing you to see the process of how lesson plans change over time.

The first goal of this course is for you, students, to develop skills as critical consumers of empirical findings within cognitive psychology through academic and news readings as well as facilitated discussions. You will learn to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of various research methods, and to judge whether the conclusions drawn from using particular methods and obtaining specific findings are justified. You will also learn to identify common behavioral results and paradigms within the field.
The second goal is to develop your skills as communicators of empirical research within cognitive psychology. Through science communication and summary pieces, peer feedback, and reading responses to empirical articles, you will hone your ability to communicate effectively about cognitive psychology and learn how to synthesize academic findings.
The third goal is to apply your skills as critical consumers of cognitive psychology to current issues in psychology and neuroscience, such as open science, good pedagogical practices, and diversity. For example, you will write a Wikipedia page for a current female or underrepresented cognitive scientist, including their biography and three of their most cited findings, to promote a more visibly inclusive face of cognitive psychology (e.g., project first started by Jess Wade). At the end of the course, the instructor will email the scientist who you profiled, with you CC’d and your profile attached, so that you can continue to belong to the cognitive psychology community.

I wish we were able to go more in depth about certain concepts rather than doing a lot of different types of projects. Perhaps these projects would have been better over the course of a semester, rather than a summer session, because they felt very condensed.

I think that while it was a small class, that helped foster a positive learning environment for the students to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts.",Maybe by offering office hours?,I think the course should be more content-based and less focussed on the small projects. I found the the projects did not better my understanding of cognitive psychology.,I think that memory should have been focussed on more. ,1,,4,4,4,5,5,,yes,yes
